# nvim Configuration by Sett17 🚀

Welcome to my `nvim` configuration! If you're looking for a setup that's as cool as a cucumber 🥒 but doesn't try too hard to be the life of the party, you're in the right place.

## Features:

- Uses the **lazy plugin manager**. Because why rush things? Life's too short to load plugins in a hurry. [Check it out here](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).
- No long lists of keymaps or plugins here. Like to keep things mysterious. 🕵️‍♂️

## Prerequisites:

Before diving in, make sure you have these tools installed. They're like the Avengers, but for your `nvim` setup. Each one is a hero in its own right:

- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - Faster than Flash when it comes to searching.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - Because who doesn't like a fuzzy finder?
- [ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags) - Tag, you're it!
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - For those days when you're feeling... well, lazy.
- [justfile](https://github.com/casey/just) - It's not just a file, it's a justfile!

And probably some more.

## Final Thoughts:

Remember, it's not about the destination; it's about the journey. And with this `nvim` setup, your coding journey just got a whole lot cooler. 😎
